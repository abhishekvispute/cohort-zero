**Hi Guys,** <br/>
Via the following notes, I would like to share and verify my understanding of ETH2.0 and general scalability solutions (Plasma, Sharding, RollUps). <br/>
Per day I would try to extend it.
Please correct me whenever I am wrong. <br/>
Okay, let's start :)

**Why ETH 2.0 ?**
There are 2 problems which are blocking us from our goal of becoming a world computer.

1) Sustainability :
POW as consensus -> Environmental Impact, Higher System requirement ->Centrlisation

2) Scalability :
Very low transaction throughput, Rising Gas Price 

This is exactly where ETH2.0 start improving on

**Sustainability**  <br/>
**Replacing POW to POS**  <br/>
Rather than Every Miner racing to prove they are worthy to mine blocks in search of mining rewards,
Now we would have Validators who stake their ETH as a collateral with reward/penalizing system for valid/invalid block.

How this makes ETH2.0 sustainable is <br/>
Validators are not racing in POS as Miners do in POW,  <br/>
It's not like only one would be a winner so you must have the best graphics card to be ahead. <br/>
It is not like if you win others efforts go in vain <br/>
It is like  <br/>
All validators act as one unit collectively per epoch. <br/>
So all efforts add up <br/>
You don't need the best hardware you only need to agree with your peers <br/>
And we hope peers (2/3) are true. :) <br/>

Which do you think is more decentralized? <br/>
I leave it for you to decide. <br/> My vote goes to POS

There is one more point. <br/>
How ETH2.0 going to stop centralization in the case of large stakers. <br/>
I think it's done via a combination of the max cap of 32ETH and committees. <br/>
Don't know completely. <br/>
Will update it here tomorrow. 

**Next Topics** <br/>

**Scalability Solutions** <br/>
Don't you think increasing block size and decreasing block gen time would mitigate this? :) 
We will see why its theory only 
 1. **Sharding** <br/>
 Rather than 100 people solving 10 puzzles  <br/>
 10 Batches of 10 people solve 100 puzzles  <br/>
 We will see what it is and what problems it adds - Inter-shard communication
 2. **Plasma**
 Sidechains with Checkpoints,
 We will see while this is a brilliant proposal, how Plasma-Exit blocks it
 4. **RollUps**
 Sidechains with Batch Submit


**TradeOffs we had to do in ETH2.0** Like reasoning behind certain choices <br/>
